Support for old kernel versions
===============================

The driver is known to not build for v2.6.32 kernels. Exact errors are unknown,
though it is likely that kernel API functions are incompatible or not supported
in v2.6.32. Patches to fix the problem will be accepted as long as they are
implemented in compat.h.
